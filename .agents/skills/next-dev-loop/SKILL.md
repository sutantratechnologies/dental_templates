description: >
  Verify Next.js runtime behavior after editing app code. Use this
  skill to confirm a change actually works in a running app — not
  just that it compiles or type-checks. Combines /_next/mcp
  (Next.js's view) with agent-browser (the browser's view).
  Requires a running `next dev`.

# next-dev-loop

The edit/verify rhythm during `next dev` — make a change, then
confirm it actually works at runtime, not only that the types or
the build are happy.

You verify through two views of the same running app:

- **`/_next/mcp`** — an HTTP endpoint Next.js exposes about itself.
  Knows framework-specific things: routes, segments, RSC, server
  actions, server logs, and errors as Next.js saw them. Call
  `tools/list` for the current surface.
- **`agent-browser`** — a CLI that drives a real Chrome. Knows
  framework-agnostic browser things: DOM, console, network, React
  fiber, vitals. Before driving it, run `agent-browser skills get core`
  once for the version-matched usage guide — don't guess subcommands
  from memory.

The two views cross-check each other.

## requires

- Next.js **16.3+** with **Turbopack** — `/_next/mcp` plus the
  proactive compile check via `get_compilation_issues`.
- `agent-browser` **>= 0.31.1** — React introspection, worktree-scoped
  `session id`, idempotent `--restore`, and launch flag reconciliation.

## reference

All tools below are present once preflight passes:
- `get_project_metadata`
- `get_routes`
- `get_errors`
- `get_page_metadata`
- `get_logs`
- `get_server_action_by_id`
- `get_compilation_issues`
- `compile_route`
